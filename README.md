# SYSC2006-Projects

Compilation of all SYSC2006 projects I completed during second year.
The projects were done in Pelles C. Most main.c files were provided by Prof. Lynn Marshall in Carleton University, suplementary files provided
by the authors indicated in the files.

This is purely for documentation.
